# InstaBrute Two Ways to Brute-force Instagram Account Hacking

### what is a InstaBrute

Instagram contained two distinct vulnerabilities that allowed an attacker to brute-force
passwords of user accounts. Combined with user enumeration, a weak password policy
no 2FA nor other mitigating security controls, this could have allowed an attacker to compromise 
many accounts without any user interaction, including high-profile ones. 
Facebook fixed both issues and awarded a combined bounty of $5.000.
